# **Brick** Buster -- ECE564 Project

Brick Buster is a 2D cartoon-style Breakout game developed based on SpriteKit.

Made by:Cheng Peng(cp286), Zhihao Qin(zq33), Tianle Zhang(tz94).

## Configuration

## Configuration

#### Setup

All setup is done inside the code. Just clone the repo and build in Xcode and you should be good to go! ðŸ˜Š (Preparing package dependency could take about two minutes.)

#### Logging in

When starting the game, you need to input you name. **Password is not required.** Brick Buster will fetch your information based on the name you input if you logged before, otherwise a new account will be created for you. If no name is inputed, **the default name is "Spider Man"**.

#### Database Access

We use AWS DynamoDB to store our data. Database authentication has been already completed inside the code so **you don't need to config it to play the game**. But if you are curious what it looks like, you can login by the following instructions:

1. Click the website https://407727436354.signin.aws.amazon.com/console to log in AWS.
2. Username: `tianleFull`, password `ece564`
3. Access [DynamoDB](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home?region=us-east-1#tables:selected=GameUserData;tab=items).



## Key Features

#### Scenes & Pages

1. Main page

   After logging in, the user will be brought to our main menu with an animated background. On this page, the user will see several buttons to click on. 

   - The first button is PLAY, which will bring the user to the `stages page`, where he/she will be able to choose which stage to play and what props to use. 
   - The second button is STORE, which will let users enter our prop store to purchase props. 
   - The next button is RANKINGS, where the user will see his/her own ranking among other players. 
   - The last button is SETTINGS, enabling the user to adjust volumes and choose his/her paddle skin.

2. Store page

   In our prop store, the user will see how many coins and props he/she has. **By clicking on the prop items, the user will see a popup menu showing what the prop can do.** Then the user can choose how many props he/she wants and checkout. If the user does not have enough coins, a warning will show, otherwise, the purchase is complete.

3. Settings page

   In the settings page, there are three things a user can adjust:

   - The **music volume** controls the background music that is always on

   - The **sound controls** the feedback when a button is clicked. 
   - The skin scroller controls the **skin of the paddle** to use for the game. There are four skins to choose from (but panda is our favorite!).

4. Ranking page

   In the ranking page, the user can see all the players and their scores in this game. He/she can scroll to see his own position in this ranking.

5. Stage page

   In the stages page, there are 9 stages to choose from. Stages which the user has unlocked will be shown with its stage number and be able to be selected, and **stages yet to be unlocked will be shown with a lock** and the user will not be able to select it. Besides selecting a stage, the user can also choose whether they want to use the props they have. After that the user is ready to click on the PLAY button and start the game.



#### Inside the Game

1. **SpriteKit** for physical effects

   We applied the SpriteKit framework to help us build this 2D game. With SpriteKit, we can easily build the physical world and use all physics effects. For the basic game logic, we use SKSpriteNode to create all of the elements in this game, including balls, bricks, props and stones. Also, we create physicsBodys for all of the nodes, so that we can implement the physics effect, especially the collision effect. We set categoryBitMask for each node, such that when a collision happens, we can tell it happens on which two elements and then apply the proper effects.
   
2. **Slide and hold your finger to shoot the first ball.** The shooting angle depends on the position you release your finger.


3. Props

   When a ball hits a brick, there is a possibility that a prop will fall down at a fixed speed. There are five kinds of props.

4. When a ball hits the paddle, **the ball**, instated of simply rebonding, **will** **rebound in a direction based on the position of collision.** For example, if the ball touches the left side of the paddle, it will then go up left  no matter what the input angle is.

5. Animation

   - Fire effects on balls at the game.
   - When breaking bricks at the game, bamboo fragments will sputter.
   - Some leaves fall down on the main scene.

#### Database

We use **AWS DynamoDB** to store our user data. DynamoDB is a cloud-based no-sql database developed by Amazon Web Service. The user data table we created has several attributes, including name, score, coin, current progress, music volume, etc. The first name and the last name are the primary key of the table. In Swift, we have a struct called DataModel to store data in memory and this will keep synchronized to DynamoDB at some time.

Use cases:

1. **Logging in:** when the app starts and after the user inputs first name & last name, our app will search on DynamoDB. If this name was used before, the stored data will be transferred back to the phone and translated as DataModel. Otherwise, a new entry in DynamoDB will be created. 
2. **Data update:** when the user sets something or gets new scores in the game, the new information will be sent to DynamoDB and the corresponding entry will be updated.
3. **Rankings:** in the rankings page, all entries in DynamoDB will be fetched and sorted by their scores in descending order.All changes on DynamoDB will be made instantly, so the rankings are updated at the real time.



## Acknowledgement

#### Package Dependency

This app used three external packages.

- DynamoDB: database related package.
- MBProgressHUD: a fancy progress bar. Will appear when waiting for logging in.
- PokerCard: a fancy alert. Will appear when logging in successfully, or buying goods in the store without enough coins.

#### Resource

- We read [a Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/1160-how-to-make-a-breakout-game-with-spritekit-and-swift-part-2) for reference. Some pictures are from here. It contains very fundamental logic of SpriteKit and state machine. The functionality from this resources is not written in the "Key Features" part in this README.
